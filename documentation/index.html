Development takes place here: http://code.google.com/p/youtubehd/


'''YouTube HD Ultimate''' is a userscript for YouTube which aims primarily to select the highest video quality a user's computer can handle. It has many other features and the developer intends on adding as many features as possible, as long as they are minimalistic and do not drastically impact the appearance of YouTube or the performance of the script.

It is the first script to innovate two of the most popular features requested for YouTube: autobuffer and HD support.

==Features==

=== Code Features ===

==== Minimal Code ====
This script requires no external libraries and is much shorter than similar all-in-one YouTube scripts.

==== Auto-update ====
Script automatically updates itself, performs one check per day, or you can run a check manually from the options dialog.

==== Options ====
This script has many configurable options. In the upper-right hand corner of a video page, there is a link inserted which says "Show Ultimate Options", with a blue background. Rolling the mouse over a link provides helpful information about what each option does.

=== Core ===

==== High Quality ====
This script is one of the fastest for simply selecting the highest quality video. If your computer can handle 720p but not 1080p, you can choose this in the script's options. Selecting a quality will ensure that YouTube selects up to, but not over that amount for your videos.

==== Loop ====
You can loop videos using the animated icon to the right of the video title.

==== Download ====
Videos can be downloaded in all the possible formats (including HD if available).

==== Fit To Window ====
The video player is re-sized to the window, ensuring optimal screen real estate.

==== Disable Annoyances ====
You can hide annotations and in-video advertisements.

==== Autobuffer ====
You can disable autoplay, but the video still downloads, a term the developer coined as "autobuffer".

==== Colors ====
Using the old player, you can change the two primary colors of the video player.

==== Lights out ====
You can darken the video page.

==== Keyboard Shortcuts ====
Has various keyboard shortcuts for pausing, playing, rewinding, stopping and volume.

==== Mini-player ====
Has a mini-player mode which only shows the player controls. Perfect for those who use YouTube for music and don't want to see a poorly made slideshow or AMV.

==== HQ Link share ====
You can get a link to share with your friends who may not have the script, but will link to the HQ / HD version so they may see it too. Also, if you choose, the link will include the exact time you are into the video.

== Issues ==
===Bugs===
Bugs for this script are hosted on {{External|http://code.google.com/p/youtubehd/issues/entry|Google Code}}.

===Compatibility===
This script is guaranteed to work in a clean profile of the latest stable version of Firefox. It is is known to have issues with Safari, Google Chrome and most likely Internet Explorer. The developer may consider adding Opera support, but encourages Opera users to switch to Firefox or Chrome in the meantime.
